This repository contains R code to replicate the analyses in the 
manuscript "Water availability dictates how plant traits predict 
demographic rates," by Alice Stears, Peter Adler, Dana Blumenthal, 
Julie Kray, Troy Ocheltree, Kevin Mueller, and Daniel Laughlin, and
was published in Ecology in 2022. 
Readers can use these scripts to replicate our analyses. Data used in these anlyses include 
previously published data sets that are detailed in the manuscript as well as novel data 
that is archived in [this](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.31zcrjdp5) Dryad repository . Scripts should be run in numerical 
order, starting with "0_NearestNeighborCalcs.R"
